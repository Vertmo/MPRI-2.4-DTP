\begin{document}
  % Everything you do should be done inside the questionnaire environment.

  % If you don't like the default text at the beginning of each questionnaire
  % you can remove it with the optional [noinfo] parameter for the environment 
  \begin{questionnaire}
    % There is a predefined "info" style to hilight some text.
    \begin{info}
      By ``the course'', I mean the last part of MPRI 2.4, on the topic of ``dependently-typed functional programming''.
